# Code of Conduct

## Using Git
1. No direct pushing to main.
2. All new code for pull requests MUST go through the dev branch first
3. Create a branch per task/feature
4. Pull Requests - Only make pull requests through Git Hub
```
git pull // This will pull only from the branch you are working on
git push origin // Push code to github on same branch
```
5. IF YOU DESIRE, Merging in VSCODE
```
git pull origin dev // Have fun merging conflicts in VSCODE
```
